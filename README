description: Extra keyboard button handler for Windows - Maximize or restore top window by one press
I used to have 2 different keyboards with many extra buttons and no use for them. This is one of the useful actions to attach to one of them. 

content: 
  1. copy MaxWindow.exe to some permanent location - for example: C:\Program Files\MaxWindow\MaxWindow.exe
  2. register you keyboard handler to execute the file on special button press event (it can be also global shortcut as F11..)
  3. use the advantage of useful shortcut (one extra button instead of using mouse)
